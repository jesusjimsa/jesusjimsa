## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer at Verifone, based in Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪. I'm from Granada, Spain 🇪🇸. My main expertise is in embedded systems—especially **C**, **Yocto**, and **Embedded Linux**—but I'm also passionate about mobile development and building automated bots for social media.

I love working on projects that have a real-world impact and can improve people’s lives. My curiosity often leads me to explore new technologies and tackle side projects that bridge hardware and software. I also know some **Swift** and am working on releasing my first app!
